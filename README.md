# UNC Basketball Quiz

# A quiz about UNC Basketball trivia that gives you a score based on questions answered correctly and a fan rating based on score.

# Procedures and Functions: We used them to create a way to run through certain task we wanted the program to accomplish.
# Adding variables: We created many new variables to keep track of different thigs throughout this project.
